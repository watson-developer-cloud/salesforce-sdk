/**
 * ### Service Overview
 *  The IBM Speech to Text service provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface
 * (API) that enables you to add IBM's speech transcription capabilities to your applications. The service also supports
 * an asynchronous HTTP interface for transcribing audio via non-blocking calls. And it supports a customization
 * interface that lets you expand the vocabulary of a base model with domain-specific terminology or adapt a base model
 * for the acoustic characteristics of your audio.
 *
 *  The service transcribes speech from various languages and audio formats to text with low latency. The service
 * supports transcription of the following languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Modern
 * Standard Arabic, Spanish, UK English, and US English. For most languages, the service supports two sampling rates,
 * broadband and narrowband.
 * ### API Overview
 * The Speech to Text service provides the following endpoints:
 * * `/v1/models` returns information about the language models that are available for speech recognition.
 * * `/v1/recognize` (sessionless) includes a single method that provides a simple means of transcribing audio without
 * the overhead of establishing and maintaining a session, but it lacks some of the capabilities available with
 * sessions.
 * * `/v1/sessions` provides a collection of methods that provide a mechanism for a client to maintain a long,
 * multi-turn exchange, or session, with the service or to establish multiple parallel conversations with a particular
 * instance of the service.
 * * `/v1/recognitions` (asynchronous) provides a set of non-blocking methods for submitting, querying, and deleting
 * jobs for recognition requests with the asynchronous HTTP interface. The interface includes calls to register
 * (white-list) and unregister a callback URL.
 * * `/v1/customizations` provides methods for creating and managing custom language models. Custom language models let
 * you expand the vocabulary of a base model with domain-specific terminology.
 * * `/v1/customizations/{customization_id}/corpora` provides methods for managing the corpora associated with a custom
 * language model. You add corpora to extract out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from the corpora into the custom language
 * model's vocabulary. You can add, list, and delete corpora from a custom language model.
 * * `/v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words` includes methods for managing individual words in a custom language
 * model. You can add, modify, list, and delete words from a custom language model.
 * * `/v1/acoustic_customizations` provides methods for creating and managing custom acoustic models. The interface lets
 * you adapt a base model for the audio characteristics of your environment and speakers.
 * * `/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/audio` provides methods for managing the audio resources associated
 * with a custom acoustic model. You add audio resources that closely match the acoustic characteristics of the audio
 * that you want to transcribe. You can add, list, and delete audio resources from a custom acoustic model.
 *
 *
 * **Note about the Try It Out feature:** The `Try it out!` button lets you experiment with the methods of the API by
 * making actual cURL calls to the service. The feature is **not** supported for use with the the session-based `POST
 * /v1/sessions/{session_id}/recognize` and sessionless `POST /v1/recognize` methods. For examples of calls to these
 * methods, see the [Speech to Text API reference](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text/api/v1/).
 * ### API Usage
 * The following information provides details about using the service to transcribe audio:
 * * **HTTP REST interfaces:** You can use methods of the session-based, sessionless, or asynchronous HTTP interfaces to
 * pass audio data to the service. All interfaces let you send the data via the body of the request; the session-based
 * and sessionless methods also let you pass data as multipart form data. With the former approach, you control the
 * transcription via a collection of request headers and query parameters. With the latter, you control the
 * transcription primarily via JSON metadata sent as form data.
 * * **WebSocket interface:** The service also offers a WebSocket interface as an alternative to its HTTP interfaces.
 * The WebSocket interface supports efficient implementation, lower latency, and higher throughput. The interface
 * establishes a persistent connection with the service, eliminating the need for session-based calls from the HTTP
 * interface. See [The WebSocket interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/websockets.html).
 * * **Audio formats:** The service supports a variety of popular audio formats. For more information, including links
 * to a number of Internet sites that provide technical and usage details about the different formats, see [Audio
 * formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
 * * **Audio transmission:** You can pass the audio to be transcribed as a one-shot delivery or in streaming mode. With
 * one-shot delivery, you pass all of the audio data to the service at one time. With streaming mode, you send audio
 * data to the service in chunks over a persistent connection. To use streaming, you must pass the `Transfer-Encoding`
 * request header with a value of `chunked`. Both forms of data transmission impose a limit of 100 MB of total data for
 * transcription. See [Audio
 * transmission](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission).
 * * **Authentication:** You authenticate to the service by using your service credentials. You can use your credentials
 * to authenticate via a proxy server that resides in IBM Cloud, or you can use your credentials to obtain a token and
 * contact the service directly. See [Service credentials for Watson
 * services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-credentials.html) and [Tokens for
 * authentication](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-tokens.html).
 * * **Request Logging:** By default, all Watson services log requests and their results. Data is collected only to
 * improve the Watson services. If you do not want to share your data, set the header parameter
 * `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` to `true` for each request. Data is collected for any request that omits this header. See
 * [Controlling request logging for Watson
 * services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-logging.html).
 *
 * For more information about the service and its various interfaces, see [About Speech to
 * Text](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/index.html).
 * ### Customization API Usage
 *   The following information pertains to methods of the customization interface:
 * * Language model customization and acoustic model customization are available only for a limited set of languages.
 * They are generally available for production use for some languages but are beta offerings for other languages. For a
 * complete list of supported languages and the status of their availability, see [Language support for
 * customization](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/custom.html#languageSupport).
 * * In all cases, you must use service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns a custom model to
 * use the methods described in this documentation with that model. For more information, see [Ownership of custom
 * language models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/custom.html#customOwner).
 * * How the service handles request logging for the customization interface depends on the request. The service does
 * not log data that are used to build custom models. But it does log data when a custom model is used with a
 * recognition request. For more information, see [Request logging and data
 * privacy](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/custom.html#customLogging).
 * * Each custom model is identified by a customization ID, which is a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). A GUID is a
 * hexadecimal string that has the same format as Watson service credentials: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.
 * You specify a custom model's GUID with the appropriate customization parameter of methods that support customization.
 *
 *
 * For more information about using the service's customization interface, see [The customization
 * interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/custom.html).

  /**

   *
   * Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the user whose service credentials are used to create it. How you learn the status and results of a job depends on the parameters you include with the job creation request: * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` query parameter to specify a URL to which the service is to send callback notifications when the status of the job changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and `user_token` query parameters to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included with each notification for the job. * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token` query parameters. You must then use the `GET /v1/recognitions` or `GET /v1/recognitions/{id}` methods to check the status of the job, using the latter to retrieve the results when the job is complete.  The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job status or obtain results from the service manually even if you include a callback URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to specify how long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. Note that using the HTTPS `GET /v1/recognitions/{id}` method to retrieve results is more secure than receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it provides confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.   The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket recognition requests. The service imposes a data size limit of 100 MB. It automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during transcoding. (For the `audio/l16` format, you can specify the endianness.)   **Note:** You can pass the `interim_results` parameter with a recognition request made with the HTTP asynchronous interface. However, the service sends all results, both interim and final, at the same time, when the request completes. The service does **not** return interim results as it generates them.

   * Registers a callback URL for use with the asynchronous interface
   *
   * Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous recognition requests. The service attempts to register, or white-list, the callback URL if it is not already registered by sending a `GET` request to the callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the `challenge_string` query parameter of the request. The request includes an `Accept` header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.   To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request from the service. The response must send status code 200 and must include the challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header to `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original `POST` registration request with response code 201.   The service sends only a single `GET` request to the callback URL. If the service does not receive a reply with a response code of 200 and a body that echoes the challenge string sent by the service within five seconds, it does not white-list the URL; it instead sends status code 400 in response to the `POST` registration request. If the requested callback URL is already white-listed, the service responds to the initial registration request with response code 200.   If you specify a user secret with the request, the service uses it as a key to calculate an HMAC-SHA1 signature of the challenge string in its response to the `POST` request. It sends this signature in the `X-Callback-Signature` header of its `GET` request to the URL during registration. It also uses the secret to calculate a signature over the payload of every callback notification that uses the URL. The signature provides authentication and data integrity for HTTP communications.   Once you successfully register a callback URL, you can use it with an indefinite number of recognition requests. You can register a maximum of 20 callback URLS in a one-hour span of time.

You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add a corpus to it. Note that adding a corpus does not affect the custom language model until you train the model for the new data by using the `POST /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/train` method.   Submit a plain text file that contains sample sentences from the domain of interest to enable the service to extract words in context. The more sentences you add that represent the context in which speakers use words from the domain, the better the service's recognition accuracy. For guidelines about adding a corpus text file and for information about how the service parses a corpus file, see [Preparing a corpus text file](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-resource.html#prepareCorpus).   The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the corpus is valid. The service then asynchronously processes the contents of the corpus and automatically extracts new words that it finds. This can take on the order of a minute or two to complete depending on the total number of words and the number of new words in the corpus, as well as the current load on the service. You cannot submit requests to add additional corpora or words to the custom model, or to train the model, until the service's analysis of the corpus for the current request completes. Use the `GET /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/corpora/{corpus_name}` method to check the status of the analysis.   The service auto-populates the model's words resource with any word that is not found in its base vocabulary; these are referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. You can use the `GET /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words` method to examine the words resource, using other words method to eliminate typos and modify how words are pronounced as needed.   To add a corpus file that has the same name as an existing corpus, set the allow_overwrite query parameter to true; otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting an existing corpus causes the service to process the corpus text file and extract OOV words anew. Before doing so, it removes any OOV words associated with the existing corpus from the model's words resource unless they were also added by another corpus or they have been modified in some way with the `POST /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words` or `PUT /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words/{word_name}` method.   The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model to a maximum of 10 million total words from all corpora combined. Also, you can add no more than 30 thousand new custom words to a model; this includes words that the service extracts from corpora and words that you add directly.

  /**
   * Trains a custom acoustic model
   *
   * Initiates the training of a custom acoustic model with new or changed audio resources. After adding or deleting audio resources for a custom acoustic model, use this method to begin the actual training of the model on the latest audio data. The custom acoustic model does not reflect its changed data until you train it. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to train it.   The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes or hours to complete depending on the total amount of audio data on which the model is being trained and the current load on the service. Typically, training takes approximately twice the length of the total audio contained in the custom model. The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to indicate that the training process has begun.   You can monitor the status of the training by using the `GET /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}` method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check the status once a minute. The method returns an `Customization` object that includes `status` and `progress` fields. A status of `available` indicates that the custom model is trained and ready to use. The service cannot accept subsequent training requests, or requests to add new audio resources, until the existing request completes.   You can use the optional `custom_language_model_id` query parameter to specify the GUID of a separately created custom language model that is to be used during training. Specify a custom language model if you have verbatim transcriptions of the audio files that you have added to the custom model or you have either corpora (text files) or a list of words that are relevant to the contents of the audio files. For information about creating a separate custom language model, see [Creating a custom language model](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-create.html).   Training can fail to start for the following reasons: * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as another training request or a request to add audio resources to the model. * The custom model contains less than 10 minutes or more than 50 hours of audio data. * One or more of the custom model's audio resources is invalid.

  /**
   * Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model
   *
   * Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model. Add audio content that reflects the acoustic characteristics of the audio that you plan to transcribe. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add an audio resource to it. Adding audio data does not affect the custom acoustic model until you train the model for the new data by using the `POST /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/train` method.   You can add individual audio files or an archive file that contains multiple audio files. Adding multiple audio files via a single archive file is significantly more efficient than adding each file individually. * You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. Use the `Content-Type` header to specify the format of the audio file. * You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio files in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. All audio files added with the same archive file must have the same audio format. Use the `Content-Type` header to specify the archive type, `application/zip` or `application/gzip`. Use the `Contained-Content-Type` header to specify the format of the contained audio files; the default format is `audio/wav`.   You can use this method to add any number of audio resources to a custom model by calling the method once for each audio or archive file. But the addition of one audio resource must be fully complete before you can add another. You must add a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 50 hours of audio that includes speech, not just silence, to a custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio resource, audio- or archive-type, can be larger than 100 MB.   The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds to complete depending on the duration of the audio and, in the case of an archive file, the total number of audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response code if the audio is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files and automatically extracts information about the audio such as its length, sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot submit requests to add additional audio resources to a custom acoustic model, or to train the model, until the service's analysis of all audio files for the current request completes.   To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the `GET /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/audio/{audio_name}` method to poll the status of the audio. The method accepts the GUID of the custom model and the name of the audio resource, and it returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio every few seconds until it becomes `ok`.   **Note:** The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model for the custom model: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
